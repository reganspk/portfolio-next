# Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This guide
will walk you through installing React and help you get started with your first
project.

## Why React?

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React’s modular structure allows you to
  build reusable components, making development faster and more efficient.
- **Declarative Syntax**: With React, you only describe how your UI should look
  at any given point in time, and React updates the UI automatically when data
  changes.
- **Strong Community Support**: React is widely used, meaning there’s a vast
  amount of resources, tutorials, and community support.
- **Efficient Rendering**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates, making
  apps faster and more responsive.
