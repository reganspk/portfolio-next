# Introduction to Expo and React Native CLI

React Native allows you to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
Both **Expo** and **React Native CLI** offer different workflows for React
Native development. Expo simplifies the setup and development process, while
React Native CLI offers more customization and control.

---

## Why Use Expo vs. React Native CLI?

- **Expo**: Great for beginners, faster to set up, and no need for Xcode/Android
  Studio for basic apps.
- **React Native CLI**: Offers greater flexibility for custom native code and
  configurations.

---

## Installation of Expo CLI

1. **Install Expo CLI**  
   To install the Expo CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
2. **Create a New Expo Project**  
   After installing Expo CLI, create a new project:

```bash
expo init my-project
cd my-project
npm start

```

## Installation of React Native CLI

1. **Install React Native CLI**  
   To install React Native CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g react-native-cli

   ```

2. **Create a New React Native Project**  
   Use the following command to initialize a new project:

   ```bash
   npx react-native init MyApp
   cd MyApp
   npx react-native run-android   # or npx react-native run-ios for iOS
   ```

## Conclusion

Both **Expo CLI** and **React Native CLI** are excellent tools for React Native
development. **Expo** is great for quick development, while **React Native CLI**
gives you more control over the native parts of your app. Choose based on your
project requirements and level of customization needed.
